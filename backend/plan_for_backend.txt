Plan for Building Backend from Scratch:

Information Gathered:
- Backend folder is empty with no existing Flask app, models, migrations, or seed data.
- User wants backend in Python with Flask.
- ERD diagram provided with tables: users, budgets, categories, expenses.

Plan:
1. Setup Flask app (backend/app.py) with:
   - Flask
   - Flask SQLAlchemy for ORM
   - Flask-Migrate for migrations
   - Configuration for database URI (SQLite for simplicity)

2. Create models (backend/models/models.py):
   - User model with id, username, email, password
   - Budget model with id, user_id (FK), amount, month
   - Category model with id, name
   - Expense model with id, user_id (FK), category_id (FK), amount, date, description

3. Setup migrations:
   - Initialize Flask-Migrate
   - Create migration scripts
   - Provide commands to run migrations

4. Seed data (backend/db/seed.py):
   - Create sample users, budgets, categories, expenses
   - Provide command to run seed script

5. Git commands:
   - git add .
   - git commit -m "Setup backend with Flask, models, migrations, and seed data"
   - git push origin main

Dependent Files to be edited/created:
- backend/app.py
- backend/models/models.py
- backend/db/seed.py
- backend/config.py (for configuration)

Followup steps:
- Implement the above files and logic
- Run migrations and seed database
- Test backend API endpoints (optional)
- Push commits to GitHub

Please confirm if you approve this plan to proceed with implementation.
